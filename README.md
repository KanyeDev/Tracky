# Tracky

## Description
Tracky is a comprehensive habit tracker designed to help users improve their productivity and achieve their goals. By providing a visual representation of habit completion on a heatmap, Tracky motivates users to stay consistent. Whether you're aiming to build new habits, break old ones, or simply track your daily tasks, Tracky offers an intuitive platform to support your journey toward personal growth and productivity.

## Motivation
Building and maintaining habits can be challenging, especially without a clear way to track progress. Many people struggle to visualize their progress, which can lead to decreased motivation and eventual abandonment of their goals. Tracky was created to address this issue by offering a simple yet powerful tool to monitor habit completion. By using a heatmap to visualize progress, users can see at a glance how well they're sticking to their habits, making it easier to stay motivated and accountable.

## What's coming next? 
Another new feature I am looking to add to the next Tracky update is the ability to lock your device away, as most times our devices tend to keep us distracted from important tasks at hand, hence we spend a lot of time on our devices which would be bad for productivity.
